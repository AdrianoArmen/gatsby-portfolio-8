## Project Description 📋

This professional portfolio was designed to showcase my versatility to work with different front-end technologies. Taking into account that my main portfolio is already built using React and deployed. I created a fresh new one-page portfolio this time utilizing a React-based, GraphQL powered, static site generator called GatsbyJS. I took a Gatsby featured started to create the structure of my project then I customized internal components, getting a chance to identify the differences and similarities between this SSG and regular Regular app creation, as far as routing, hosting images, and directory organization.
